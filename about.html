        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
          Hello, I'm Kumar raja, a passionate web developer based in bihar.
          I love creating beautiful and functional websites and web applications
          that provide a great user experience. My journey into web development
          started a few years ago, and I have been constantly learning and
          improving my skills since then.
        </p>
        <p>
          My specialization lies in Full-Stack development, with a keen focus on 
          both Front-End and Back-End technologies. I have a strong foundation in 
          programming languages such as Java, JavaScript, and SQL, along with 
          experience in frameworks like Express-JS. My backend and database skills 
          include working with MongoDB, SQL plus, and NodeJS.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring nature, reading books,
          or enjoying a cup of coffee with friends.
        </p>
